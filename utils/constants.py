# Covers: semaphore wait + embedding call + vector DB query (pgvector/Pinecone/Qdrant/etc.).
# 15 s is the safe default for most self-hosted and cloud vector backends.
# Users on fast local-only stacks can lower this via the tool's `timeout` parameter.
# NOTE: This is the default for tools unless overridden by tool parameter `timeout`.

# Extraction operation timeouts (for batch memory extraction)

# - Multiple API calls to Dify (conversations + messages)

# Extraction conversation processing limits
# Maximum tokens per conversation for memory extraction.
# The value is expressed in thousands of tokens (K) for consistency with tool parameters.
# Default: 64K tokens - suitable for most modern LLMs:
# - GPT-4o: 128K context window
# - Claude 3.5: 200K context window
# - GPT-4 Turbo: 128K context window
# This is a configurable parameter that can be adjusted based on the actual LLM used.

# Design rationale:
#   episodic  (14d) – event memories are time-bound; "Met John yesterday" is

#   semantic  (45d) – stable user traits; a preference unseen for 4-5 months
#                     in an active assistant is suspicious but still plausible.
#   procedural(90d) – workflow memories surface only in specific contexts; a
#                     3-month gap between relevant queries is normal, so they
#                     need a longer grace period before being considered stale.
# Memories without a recognised subtype fall back to FORGET_S0.
